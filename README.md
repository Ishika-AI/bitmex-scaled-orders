  - Upper price and lower price
  - Spread amount evenly, increasingly or decreasingly
- Supports all Bitmex instruments
- View current positions

## Requirements

- nodeJS 8.5+

## Startup

Download latest release from https://github.com/nice-table/bitmex-scaled-orders/releases/latest or clone the project.

Open a terminal and run the following from the project folder:

- `npm install`

When `npm install` has finished, we are ready to start the app. Run this in a terminal:

- `npm run startup`

App should open in your browser automatically and render when ready.

## Upgrading

Upgrading should be as simple as overwriting the source code, or pulling latest, followed by a `npm install` in terminal. App is then ready and can be started with `npm run startup`.

## Development

When doing dev work I run `npm start` in one terminal, and `npm run proxy:dev` in another.

## Tests

Tests can be run in a terminal:

`npm test`
